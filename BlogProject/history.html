                        <p class="p-1 text-justify">Web development refers to the creating, building, and maintaining of websites. It includes aspects such as 
                            web design, web publishing, web programming, and database management. It is the creation of an application 
                            that works over the internet i.e. websites.</p>

                        <p class="p-1 text-justify">An aspiring web developer must first complete an education to develop basic coding and programming skills. 
                            In most cases, this is a computer science degree program with core courses in systems design, 
                            data management, and the essential programming languages used by industry professionals.</p>

                <h2>2. Our Future</h2>
                <p class="p-4 text-justify">Web development dates back to the rise of the world wide web as a means of connecting people 
                    across the globe. The idea of the World Wide Web was not embraced by everyone until the visually accessible
                     “web browsers” paved their way in the early 1990s. Since then, web development has been in play in making things 
                     and information more accessible and digitally attractive to people. This field has been evolving constantly,
                      from HTML and CSS to JavaScript frameworks and server-side programming. </p>
