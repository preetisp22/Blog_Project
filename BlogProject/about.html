                <h3>&nbsp; &nbsp; 1. What is web development</h3>
                <p class="p-4 text-justify">
                    Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet
                     (a private network).[1] Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text 
                     to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list 
                     of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web engineering. [2]Web design, Web content
                      development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network security configuration,
                       and e-commerce development.Among Web professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building Web sites: writing markup and coding.
                       [2] Web development may use content management systems (CMS) to 
                       make content changes easier and available with basic technical skills.

                Among Web professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of

                  to make content changes easier and available with basic technical skills.
                For larger organizations and businesses, Web development teams can consist of hundreds of people
                 (Web developers) and follow standard methods like Agile methodologies while developing Web sites.[1]
                  Smaller organizations may only require a single permanent or contracting developer, or secondary assignment
                   to related job positions such as a graphic designer or information systems technician. Web development may
                    be a collaborative effort between departments rather than the domain of a designated department. 
                    There are three kinds of Web developer specialization: front-end developer, back-end developer,
                     and full-stack developer.[3] Front-end developers are responsible for behavior and visuals that run 
                     in the user browser, while back-end developers deal with the servers.[4] Since the commercialization of 
                     the Web, the industry has boomed and has become one of the most used technologies ever.

            </p>
            <p class="p-4 text-justify">
                Web development tools (often called devtools or inspect element) allow web developers to test and debug their source code.
                 They are different from website builders and integrated development environments (IDEs) in that they do not assist
                  in the direct creation of a webpage, rather they are tools used for testing the user interface of a website or web 
                  application.Web development tools come as browser add-ons or built-in features in modern web browsers.
                  [1] Browsers such as Google Chrome,[2] Firefox,[3] Internet Explorer, Safari,[4] Microsoft Edge[5] and Opera,[6] 
                  have built-in tools to help web developers,[7] and many additional add-ons can be found in their respective plugin 
                  download centers.
